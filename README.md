Question_1_NER.ipynb - This notebook contains all the source codes for Part 1 of the assignment. It has the following sections: 

1. Data Preprocessing
2. Model Building
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
4. Final Model Building
5. Testing our model on a random test sentence

Note : The notebook was run on google colab therefore we saved the word2vec model on google drive after the first download so that we do not need to redownload it multiple times. To run on your local PC please uncomment the line where the word2vec model is downloaded using the gensim downloader and please comment out the lines where we are loading the model in from our google drive
